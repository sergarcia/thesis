\begin{table}[ht]
\caption[Simulated fluxes for \textit{$\Delta$hydG-$\Delta$ech}]{pFBA simulated fluxes from \textit{$\Delta$hydG-$\Delta$ech} case study. Only includes reactions involving NADPH or exchange reactions that have different flux between wild-type and mutant. The biomass reaction is not included due to size. Additionally, we also excluded reactions with the same fold change magnitude as the biomass reaction ($|\textrm{FC}|=0.26$), because their fluxes are likely fully correlated.}
