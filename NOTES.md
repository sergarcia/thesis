Questions:
- How to deal with supplementary files (of data/spreadsheets, etc?) (Others an be placed in the appendix) -> This files can actually be provided with the thesis (see attachements on page 10)
- (Should I keep copyright note? Not mandatory)

# Per chapter TODO:
## Introduction:
	- rewrite

## Chapter 2:
	- fix missing references
	- In section 2.3.4 edit out ModCell2 and refer to chapter 3. Last figure of this chapter should also reflect this

## Chapter 3:
	- fix missing references

## Chapters 4-7:
	- these are in latex so it should not be much trouble to add. Make sure to systematically edit references as described in general tips below

# Conclusion:
Write, include arrow figure

# Overall TODO:

- grep -R 'FIXME\|TODO'


General tips:
- For labels append the chapter number to avoid clashes: (eq:lorem) -> (eq3:lorem).

Ideas to enhance formatting (ask on vim so):
- Have a macro that removes \textbf on figure captions
- Have a macro that puts citations before punctuation signs
