abstract = {Abstract Scientific and technological progress might change people's capabilities or incentives in ways that would destabilize civilization. For example, advances in DIY biohacking tools might make it easy for anybody with basic training in biology to kill millions; novel military technologies could trigger arms races in which whoever strikes first has a decisive advantage; or some economically advantageous process may be invented that produces disastrous negative global externalities that are hard to regulate. This paper introduces the concept of a vulnerable world: roughly, one in which there is some level of technological development at which civilization almost certainly gets devastated by default, i.e. unless it has exited the ‘semi-anarchic default condition’. Several counterfactual historical and speculative future vulnerabilities are analyzed and arranged into a typology. A general ability to stabilize a vulnerable world would require greatly amplified capacities for preventive policing and global governance. The vulnerable world hypothesis thus offers a new perspective from which to evaluate the risk-benefit balance of developments towards ubiquitous surveillance or a unipolar world order.},

abstract = "With microbial production becoming the primary choice for natural product synthesis, increasing precursor and cofactor availability has become a chief hurdle for the generation of efficient production platforms. As such, we employed a stoichiometric-based model to identify combinations of gene knockouts for improving NADPH availability in Escherichia coli. Specifically, two different model objectives were used to identify possible genotypes that exhibited either improved overall NADPH production or an improved flux through an artificial reaction coupling NADPH yield to biomass. The top single, double and triple gene deletion candidates were constructed and as a case study evaluated for their ability to produce two polyphenols, leucocyanidin and (+)-catechin. Each is derived from their common precursor dihydroquercetin using two recombinant NADPH-dependent enzymes: dihydroflavonol 4-reductase and leucoanthocyanidin reductase. The best engineered strain carrying Δpgi, Δppc and ΔpldA deletions accumulated up to 817mg/L of leucocyanidin and 39mg/L (+)-catechin in batch culture with 10g/L glucose in modified M9 medium, a 4-fold and 2-fold increase, respectively, compared to the wild-type control."

	abstract = {Thiamine is a vitamin that functions as a cofactor for key enzymes in carbon and energy metabolism for all living cells. While most plants, fungi and bacteria can synthesize thiamine de novo, the oleaginous yeast, Yarrowia lipolytica, cannot. In this study, we used proteomics together with physiological characterization to understand key metabolic processes influenced and regulated by thiamine availability and identified the genetic basis of thiamine auxotrophy in Y. lipolytica. Specifically, we found thiamine depletion results in decreased protein abundance of the lipid biosynthesis pathways and energy metabolism (i.e., ATP synthase), attributing to the negligible growth and poor sugar assimilation observed in our study. Using comparative genomics, we identified the missing 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate synthase (THI13) in the de novo thiamine biosynthesis of Y. lipolytica, and discovered an exceptional promoter, P3, that exhibits strong activation or tight repression by low and high thiamine concentrations, respectively. Capitalizing on the strength of our thiamine-regulated promoter (P3) to express the missing gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (scTHI13), we engineered the thiamine-prototrophic Y. lipolytica. By comparing this engineered strain to the wildtype, we unveiled the tight relationship linking thiamine availability to lipid biosynthesis and demonstrated enhanced lipid production with thiamine supplementation in the engineered thiamine-prototrophic Y. lipolytica.IMPORTANCE Thiamine plays a crucial role as an essential cofactor for enzymes in carbon and energy metabolism of all living cells. Thiamine deficiency has detrimental consequences on cellular health. Yarrowia lipolytica, a non-conventional oleaginous yeast with broad biotechnological applications, is a native thiamine auxotroph, whose effects on cellular metabolism are not well understood. Therefore, Y. lipolytica is an ideal eukaryotic host to study thiamine metabolism, especially as mammalian cells are also thiamine-auxotrophic and thiamine deficiency is implicated in several human diseases. This study elucidates the fundamentals of thiamine deficiency on cellular metabolism of Y. lipolytica and identifies genes and novel thiamine-regulated elements that eliminate thiamine auxotrophy in Y. lipolytica. Furthermore, discovery of thiamine-regulated elements enables development of thiamine biosensors with useful applications in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.},

  abstract	= {The product architecture has a significant influence on
		  all phases of the product life cycle. Many literature
		  sources claim modular product design offers a large range
		  of advantages for addressing this influence. For example,
		  it enables mass customisation, allows environmentally
		  friendly end-of-life strategies, reduces development costs
		  and allows efficient work in loosely coupled organisations.
		  However, the generally low level of justification of these
		  advantages together with the lack of commonly accepted
		  theoretical references leads to a rather scattered view of
		  the potential of modularisation. Moreover, the diversity of
		  methodological approaches and the lack of common vocabulary
		  represent a challenge for standardisation of practices and
		  may hinder systematic implementation in product
		  development. In particular, more guidance may be required
		  to allow product development teams to choose the right
		  modularisation approach that fits in with their objectives.

		  targets. There were 17 different substrate/target pairs for
		  which over 80{\%} of the theoretical maximum potential

		  This study provides specific metabolic interventions

@Article{	  fischetti2016,
  abstract	= {Benders is one of the most famous decomposition tools for
		  Mathematical Programming, and it is the method of choice
		  e.g., in mixed-integer stochastic programming. Its hallmark
		  is the capability of decomposing certain types of models
		  into smaller subproblems, each of which can be solved
		  individually to produce local information (notably, cutting
		  planes) to be exploited by a centralized “master”
		  problem. As its name suggests, the power of the technique
		  comes essentially from the decomposition effect, i.e., the
		  separability of the problem into a master problem and
		  several smaller subproblems. In this paper we address the
		  question of whether the Benders approach can be useful even
		  without separability of the subproblem, i.e., when its
		  application yields a single subproblem of the same size as
		  the original problem. In particular, we focus on the
		  capacitated facility location problem, in two variants: the
		  classical linear case, and a “congested” case where the
		  objective function contains convex but non-separable
		  quadratic terms. We show how to embed the Benders approach
		  within a modern branch-and-cut mixed-integer programming
		  solver, addressing explicitly all the ingredients that are
		  instrumental for its success. In particular, we discuss
		  some computational aspects that are related to the negative
		  effects derived from the lack of separability. Extensive
		  computational results on various classes of instances from
		  the literature are reported, with a comparison with the
		  state-of-the-art exact and heuristic algorithms. The
		  outcome is that a clever but simple implementation of the
		  Benders approach can be very effective even without
		  separability, as its performance is comparable and
		  sometimes even better than that of the most effective and
		  sophisticated algorithms proposed in the previous
		  literature.},

Remarkably, modularity has recently been discovered as a governing principle in natural biological systems from genes to proteins to complex networks within a cell and organism communities. The convergent knowledge of natural and engineered modular systems provides a key to drive modern biotechnology to address emergent challenges associated with health, food, energy, and the environment. Here, we first present the theory and application of modular design in traditional engineering fields. We then discuss the significance and impact of modular architectures on systems biology and biotechnology. Next, we focus on the very recent theoretical and experimental advances in modular cell engineering that seeks to enable rapid and systematic development of microbial catalysts capable of efficiently synthesizing a large space of useful chemicals. We conclude with an outlook towards theoretical and practical opportunities for a more systematic and effective application of modular cell engineering in biotechnology."

		  microbial biocatalysts. However, the current strain
		  optimization process is prohibitively laborious and costly
		  to produce one target chemical and often requires new
		  engineering efforts to produce new molecules. To tackle
		  this challenge, modular cell design based on a chassis
		  strain that can be combined with different product

		  approach seeks to minimize unexpected failure and avoid

Goal attainment optimization is a mathematical framework to describe the simultaneous optimization of multiple conflicting objectives that must all reach a performance above a threshold or goal. In this study, we applied goal attainment optimization to harness natural modularity of cellular metabolism to design a modular chassis cell for optimal production of a diverse class of products, where each goal corresponds to the minimum biosynthesis requirements (e.g., yields and rates) of a target product. This modular cell design approach enables rapid generation of optimal production strains that can be assembled from a modular cell and various exchangeable production modules and hence accelerates the prohibitively slow and costly strain design process. We formulated the modular cell design problem as a blended or goal attainment mixed integer linear program, using mass-balance metabolic models as biological constraints. By applying the modular cell design framework for a genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli, we demonstrated that a library of biochemically diverse products could be effectively synthesized at high yields and rates from a modular (chassis) cell with only a few genetic manipulations. Flux analysis revealed this broad modularity phenotype is supported by the natural modularity and flexible flux capacity of core metabolic pathways. Overall, we envision the developed modular cell design framework provides a powerful tool for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering applications such as industrial biocatalysis to effectively produce fuels, chemicals, and therapeutics from renewable and sustainable feedstocks, bioremediation, and biosensing.},

  abstract	= {The metabolic byproducts secreted by growing cells can be
		  easily measured and provide a window into the state of a
		  cell; they have been essential to the development of
		  microbiology, cancer biology, and biotechnology. Progress
		  in computational modeling of cells has made it possible to
		  predict metabolic byproduct secretion with bottom-up
		  reconstructions of metabolic networks. However, owing to a
		  lack of data, it has not been possible to validate these
		  predictions across a wide range of strains and conditions.
		  Through literature mining, we were able to generate a
		  database of Escherichia coli strains and their
		  experimentally measured byproduct secretions. We simulated
		  these strains in six historical genome-scale models of E.
		  coli, and we report that the predictive power of the models
		  has increased as they have expanded in size and scope. The
		  latest genome-scale model of metabolism correctly predicts
		  byproduct secretion for 35/89 (39{\%}) of designs. The
		  next-generation genome-scale model of metabolism and gene
		  expression (ME-model) correctly predicts byproduct
		  secretion for 40/89 (45{\%}) of designs, and we show that
		  ME-model predictions could be further improved through
		  kinetic parameterization. We analyze the failure modes of
		  these simulations and discuss opportunities to improve
		  prediction of byproduct secretion.},

  abstract	= {Metabolic engineering is the science of rewiring the
		  metabolism of cells to enhance production of native
		  metabolites or to endow cells with the ability to produce
		  new products. The potential applications of such efforts
		  are wide ranging, including the generation of fuels,
		  chemicals, foods, feeds, and pharmaceuticals. However,
		  making cells into efficient factories is challenging
		  because cells have evolved robust metabolic networks with
		  hard-wired, tightly regulated lines of communication
		  between molecular pathways that resist efforts to divert
		  resources. Here, we will review the current status and
		  challenges of metabolic engineering and will discuss how
		  new technologies can enable metabolic engineering to be
		  scaled up to the industrial level, either by cutting off
		  the lines of control for endogenous metabolism or by
		  infiltrating the system with disruptive, heterologous
		  pathways that overcome cellular regulation.},
