Modular design has been the cornerstone of contemporary engineering, enabling efficient production of exchangeable parts that interact in a reproducible manner to constitute functional systems.
    In this proposed thesis, we transfer engineering modular design principles to the emerging fields of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, that have promising applications to address problems related to health, energy, security, and the environment. In particular, we focus on microbial biocatalysis which has the potential to become a renewable and lower-cost replacement of traditional chemical synthesis processes.
    The proposed thesis begins with an interdisciplinary review and pespective of the concepts, methodology, and applications of modular design.
    Then, a conceptual and mathematical framework with associated design algorithms are developed to build modular cell biocatalysts. The proposed framework is used to design modular cell systems for the production of biofuels and biochemicals in major industrial organisms such as \textit{Escherichia coli} and \textit{Clostridium thermocellum}. This modular cell design approach not only brings whole-cell biocatalysis closer to being an industrially competitive technology, but also provides tools to understand the natural modular architectures of metabolic networks designed by evolution for billions of years under physical and biological constraints.
%The modular cell design approach aims to overcome the prohibitively slow and costly research and development cycles in strain biocatalysis by eliminating redundancy and increasing robustness, pushing whole-cell biocatalysis into an industrially competitive technology.
